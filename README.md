### A new algorithm for community detection in large social networks.

#### Abstract

Networks provide a useful representation for the investigation of complex systems, and makes it possible to examine the intermediate-scale structure of such systems. Consequently, networks have attracted considerable attention in sociology, biology, computer science, and many other disciplines. The majority of intermediate-scale structure investigations have focused on community structure, where one decomposes the network into cohesive groups of nodes referred to as communities, which have a higher density of connections within than between them. With the rise of social media (e.g Facebook and Twitter), algorithms for community detection in large social networks have become increasingly important. In this work we propose a new algorithm for community detection. The algorithm proceeds by alternating three simple routines in an iterative fashion: diffusion, thresholding, and random sampling. We use our algorithm to detect communities in a large social network of 4.8 million users known as the LiveJournal Network.  We compare the performance of our algorithm with a state of the art algorithm developed by Facebook. We also conduct a thorough study of the mathematical properties of the proposed algorithm. We show that the algorithm monotonically increases some quality function describing how good is the partition of the network.
